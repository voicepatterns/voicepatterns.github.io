We see Voice Patterns helping address common challenges that arise when building voice applications such as skills for Amazon Alexa, or actions for Google Assistant.

### Who's Involved

*Voice Patterns* is an initiative among thought-leaders in the Voice Industry who are deeply passionate in seeing the growth of Voice Applications. Currently, we have a working group consisting of:

* Dustin Coates

* Jan KÃ¶nig

* Kane Simms

* Vineet Sinha

* Steve Tingris


Working group members commit to (a) driving forward the discuss about voice patterns, (b) collecting concrete insights and suggestions for review by the working group, and (c) attending group calls every other month to refine these ideas.

### History

While not the first initiative, we hope to distinguish ourselves by making sure that we collect ideas that are easily digestible. We work hard and pull in insights from previous initiatives, specifically:

* The **[VoiceXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/)** standard for interactive access through the telephone, launched by a a collaboration in 1999 of AT&T, IBM, Lucent Technologies, and Motorola.

* The Association for Conversational Interaction Design - **[ACIxD](http://acixd.org/)** was created in 2008, focusing on the needs of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems and in particular has a very helpful [wiki](http://acixd.org/wiki/doku.php).

* **[Violet](https://helloviolet.ai/)** was released in 2017 as a set of utilities to help developers implement Conversations. The challenges experienced with it resulted in a collaboration with the Violet lead Vineet Sinha (from Salesforce) and Mitchell Harris (from the Rain Agency) to document common [Conversational Design Patterns](https://github.com/salesforce/violet-conversations/wiki).
