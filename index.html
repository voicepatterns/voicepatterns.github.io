<p>
We are a cross-industry group of builders who see incredible potential in Voice Interfaces. After having built dozens of Voice Experiences and having tried many ideas, we have felt a need to come together, share lessons, and create a common vocabulary so that we can build on them.

<p>
Major ideas are finding their way on this website. We would love to hear what you think of them - please let us know in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/voice-patterns">forums</a>.</p>
